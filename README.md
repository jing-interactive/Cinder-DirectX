Cinder-DirectX
==============

Supports DX9/DX11 rendering in a standalone block.

Due to the sophisticated architecture of Cinder, I can implement DX rendering without affecting a single line of core files. 
And reusing existent classes such as `ci::TriMesh` && `ci::Matrixnn`.

I am focusing on DX11 implementation now, although DX9 is ready for play.
